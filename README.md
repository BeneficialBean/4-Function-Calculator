# 4-Function-Calculator

## Functionality
This 4 Function Calculator replicates the functions of a standard 4 function calculator you would find in any classroom. The calculator takes in console inputs and computes them according to the order of operations. The program ignores spaces and tabs in the input and handles input errors, including invalid operators, invalid inputs, and dividing by 0. Unlike a standard 4 function calculator, it does not have memory functions. 

I made this program after self-teaching C++ on learncpp.com for about a month.
