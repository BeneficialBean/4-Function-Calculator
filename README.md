## Functionality
This program replicates a standard 4-function calculator you’d find in any classroom. It reads math expressions from console input and evaluates them according to the order of operations. The calculator ignores spaces/tabs, handles invalid input (unknown operators, invalid inputs), and keeps your previous answer stored as `ans` for reuse in later expressions.

**Update:** The code has been rewritten to use stacks, queues, and the shunting yard algorithm for more efficient and cleaner expression parsing.
